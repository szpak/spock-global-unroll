# Spock Global Unroll extension

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/info.solidsoft.spock/spock-global-unroll/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/info.solidsoft.spock/spock-global-unroll)

Spock extension automatically enabling parametrized tests unrolling in the whole project.

## Quick start

It is enough to put the spock-gradle-unroll JAR on a classpath. No additional configuration is required.
All parametrized tests (features) will unrolled automatically as the `@Unroll` annotation would be put on it.

## Configuration in a project

spock-global-unroll jars are available in Maven Central.

### Gradle

```
testCompile 'info.solidsoft.spock:spock-global-unroll:0.5.1'
testCompile 'org.spockframework:spock-core:1.0-groovy-2.4'  //required as spock-global-unroll assumes that spock-core is provided
```

### Maven

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>info.solidsoft.spock</groupId>
    <artifactId>spock-global-unroll</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.spockframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spock-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-groovy-2.4</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

**Please note** that to make it easier to use spock-global-unroll with different Spock versions (like 1.0-groovy-2.0 and 1.0-groovy-2.3)
the plugin does not have compile dependency on Spock and a proper spock-core jar has to be explicitly defined in a build configuration.

## Spock compatibility

spock-global-unroll should be compatible with Spock 1.0 and possibly with its further versions.

## Usage

### Basic usage

spock-global-unroll is implemented as a Spock global extension. It means that it is enabled automatically when the spock-global-unroll jar is put on
a classpath. No further configuration is required.

### Disabling automatic unrolling for a class

Automatic unrolling can be disabled for a particular class by putting `@Roll` (or `@DisableGlobalUnroll`) on it.
 
Please note that the `@Unroll` annotations manually placed at the test (feature) level can be used to unroll particular tests anyway.

### Overriding default test name

To override default test name expanding (with `#placeHolders` in a test name) `@Unroll` annotation with a custom text can used on top of
a feature method or at the specification level.

## Migration

**Important!** Before any massive find & replace operation it is strongly recommended to commit all local changes to be able to easily restore the original state with `git reset --hard`.

### Shell commands

0. Run a complete build of the migrated project and write down a total number of tests (optional).
1. Add `spock-global-unroll` dependency to a test scope (as described above).
2. Execute the following (strange looking) command in the root of your project (or the root directory with tests):
 
    ```
    find . -type f -iname '*.groovy' -exec sed -ie ':a;N;$!ba;s/[\t ]\+\@Unroll[\r\n]\+//g' \{\} \;
    ```

3. Run a clean build of your project and verify that the number of tests is equal to (or greater then) measured before the migration.
4. Commit and push changes.

This command was tested on Linux with Fish and Bash.

Plese note that I'm not a regex/sed expert, so feel free to create a PR with proposed enhancements.

## Rationale

I've been always frustrated with the need to add `@Unroll` annotation for every parametrized test/feature (or at least at the class/specification
level) to make unrolling works. It was even worse to deal with code with already missing `@Unroll` annotations and cryptic test results.
Being able to implement automatic tests unrolling in a few lines of code I decided to share it with others.
